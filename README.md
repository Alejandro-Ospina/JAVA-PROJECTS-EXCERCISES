# JAVA-PROJECTS-EXCERCISES
Greetings dear users.
As you can see, this repository is public and has the solutions for different JAVA excercises and projects. Furthermore, you are going to find some of my own incoming projects. 
This repository will be updating in extent that more exercises are solved, or more projects are created. I'm looking forward this to help you a lot so that you can learn, and me as well. 
Blessings!!
